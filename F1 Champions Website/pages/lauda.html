                                    <p>
                                        <span>Niki Lauda</span> was born on 22 February 1949 in Vienna, Austria, 
                                        to a wealthy paper manufacturing family. His paternal grandfather 
                                        was the Viennese-born industrialist Hans Lauda. Lauda became a racing 
                                        driver despite his family's disapproval. After starting out with a 
                                        Mini, Lauda moved on into Formula Vee, as was normal in Central 
                                        Europe, but rapidly moved up to drive in private Porsche and Chevron 
                                        sports cars. With his career stalled, he took out a £30,000 bank loan,
                                        secured by a life insurance policy, to buy his way into the fledgling 
                                        March team as a Formula Two (F2) driver in 1971. Because of his 
                                        family's disapproval, he had an ongoing feud with them over his racing 
                                        ambitions and abandoned further contact. Lauda was quickly promoted to 
                                        the F1 team, but drove for March in F1 and F2 in 1972. Although the F2 
                                        cars were good (and Lauda's driving skills impressed March principal 
                                        Robin Herd), March's 1972 F1 season was catastrophic. Perhaps the lowest 
                                        point of the team's season came at the Canadian Grand Prix at Mosport Park, 
                                        where both March cars were disqualified within three laps of each other, 
                                        just past 3/4 of the race distance. Lauda took out another bank loan to buy 
                                        his way into the BRM team in 1973. Lauda was instantly quick, but the team 
                                        was in decline; although the BRM P160E was fast and easy to drive it was 
                                        not reliable and its engine lacked power. Lauda's popularity was on the 
                                        rise after he finished in 3rd at the Monaco Grand Prix that year, 
                                        resulting in Enzo Ferrari becoming interested. When his BRM teammate 
                                        Clay Regazzoni left to rejoin Ferrari in 1974, team owner

                                        asked him what he thought of Lauda. Regazzoni spoke so favorably of Lauda 
                                        that Ferrari promptly signed him, paying him enough to clear his debts.

                                        After an unsuccessful start to the 1970s, culminating in a disastrous 
                                        start to the 1973 season, Ferrari regrouped completely under Luca di 
                                        Montezemolo and were resurgent in 1974. The team's faith in the 
                                        little-known Lauda was quickly rewarded by a second-place finish in his 
                                        debut race for the team, the season-opening Argentine Grand Prix. 
                                        His first Grand Prix (GP) victory - and the first for Ferrari since 1972 - 
                                        followed only three races later in the Spanish Grand Prix. Although Lauda 
                                        became the season's pacesetter, achieving six consecutive pole positions, 
                                        a mixture of inexperience and mechanical unreliability meant Lauda won only 
                                        one more race that year, the Dutch GP. He finished fourth in the Drivers' 
                                        Championship and demonstrated immense commitment to testing and improving 
                                        the car. The 1975 F1 season started slowly for Lauda; after no better 
                                        than a fifth-place finish in the first four races, he won four of the 
                                        next five driving the new Ferrari 312T. His first World Championship was 
                                        confirmed with a third-place finish at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza.

                                        A week before the 1976 German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring, even though 
                                        he was the fastest driver on that circuit at the time, Lauda urged his 
                                        fellow drivers to boycott the race, largely because of the 23-kilometre 
                                        (14 mi) circuit's safety arrangements, citing the organisers' 
                                        lack of resources to properly manage such a huge circuit, including 
                                        lack of fire marshals, fire and safety equipment and safety vehicles. 
                                        Formula One was quite dangerous at the time (three of the drivers that
                                        day later died in Formula One incidents: Tom Pryce in 1977; Ronnie 
                                        Peterson in 1978; and Patrick Depailler in 1980), but a majority of 
                                        the drivers voted against the boycott and the race went ahead. On 1 August 
                                        1976, during the second lap at the very fast left kink before Bergwerk, 
                                        Lauda was involved in an accident where his Ferrari swerved off the track, 
                                        hit an embankment, burst into flames, and made contact with Brett Lunger's
                                        Surtees-Ford car. Unlike Lunger, Lauda was trapped in the wreckage. 
                                        Drivers Arturo Merzario, Lunger, Guy Edwards, and Harald Ertl arrived at 
                                        the scene a few moments later, but before Merzario was able to pull Lauda 
                                        from his car, he suffered severe burns to his head and hands and inhaled 
                                        hot toxic gases that damaged his lungs and blood. Lauda missed only two 
                                        races, appearing at the Monza press conference six weeks after the accident 
                                        with his fresh burns still bandaged. He finished fourth in the Italian 
                                        GP, despite being, by his own admission, absolutely petrified. Lauda's 
                                        previously good relationship with Ferrari was severely affected by his 
                                        decision to withdraw from the Japanese Grand Prix, and he endured a 
                                        difficult 1977 season, despite easily winning the championship through 
                                        consistency rather than outright pace.

                                        Lauda retired for the first time in 1979, but returned with McLaren in 1982.
                                        In 1984, he won his 3rd World Title beating

                                        Lauda retired in 1985 for second time. He sadly passed away in 2019 aged
                                        70. He left the big legacy in F1 and his story is still inspiring today.
