                                    <p>
                                        <span>Mika Häkkinen</span> was born in Helsingin maalaiskunta, 
                                        Finland, on 28 September 1968 to Harri, a shortwave radio 
                                        operator and a part-time taxi driver, and Aila Häkkinen, 
                                        who worked as a secretary. He has one sister, Nina, who ran a 
                                        fan site for her brother until its closure in 1998. 
                                        Häkkinen lived in the same street as Mika Salo with the two 
                                        later becoming friends. As a child, Häkkinen played ice 
                                        hockey and football. When Häkkinen was five years old, 
                                        his parents rented a go-kart for him to take to a track 
                                        near their home. Despite an early crash, Häkkinen wished 
                                        to continue racing, and his father bought him his first 
                                        go-kart, one that Henri Toivonen had previously competed with. 
                                        He later won his first karting race in 1975 at the Keimola Motor 
                                        Stadium where he raced in the regional karting championships in 
                                        1978 and 1979, winning the Keimola Club Championship in both 
                                        years. Häkkinen found further success in 1980 when he won the 
                                        Swedish Lapland Cup and finished fourth in the 85cc class of the 
                                        Lapland Karting Championship. Around this time, Häkkinen also 
                                        drove a Volkswagen Beetle on the frozen lakes of Finland with 
                                        friend Mika Sohlberg. In 1981, Häkkinen won his first major 
                                        karting title, the 85cc class of the Finnish Karting 
                                        Championship. The following year, he finished runner-up in the 
                                        85cc class of the Formula Mini series and later won the Ronnie 
                                        Peterson Memorial event and the Salpauselka Cup in Lahti. 
                                        Häkkinen moved to the Formula Nordic 100cc class for 1983, 
                                        where he became the champion on his first attempt and also 
                                        participated in the A Junior Team Races for Finland alongside 
                                        Taru Rinne, Jaana Nyman and Marko Mankonen, with the line-up 
                                        taking the championship.

                                        In 1990, Häkkinen applied to become a member of the 
                                        "Marlboro World Championship Team" through what was akin to 
                                        a fully sponsored racing driver academy. Its members were 
                                        short-listed for testing by a judging panel including McLaren 
                                        Formula One team boss Ron Dennis (whose team was sponsored by 
                                        Marlboro), Formula One World Champion 
                                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hunt" 
                                        target="_blank">James Hunt</a>, and Formula 
                                        3000 team bosses, Mike Earle and Hugues de Chaunac. In an April 
                                        2015 interview, Earle recounted that Häkkinen's application was 
                                        the last one that he reviewed at the end of a long day, despite 
                                        protests by Hunt who had already made plans to head to a pub for 
                                        a beer. Häkkinen performed strongly in his test and went on 
                                        to secure Marlboro's sponsorship. That same year, therefore, 
                                        Häkkinen left Dragon and moved to the West Surrey Racing team 
                                        and won the British Formula 3 series, by taking nine victories 
                                        en route to the Championship, with 121 points, ahead of fellow 
                                        Finn Salo. In November, Häkkinen entered the Macau Grand Prix 
                                        where he drove to pole position and won the first heat of the 
                                        event. He retired from the second heat due to a last-lap 
                                        collision with German Formula Three driver and future Formula 
                                        One rival <a href="schumacher.html">Michael Schumacher</a>, 
                                        who was classified as the overall winner.

                                        Häkkinen made his first test in a Formula One car with the 
                                        Benetton team driving 90 laps around the Silverstone Circuit 
                                        and set quicker lap times than regular driver Alessandro Nannini.
                                        He found it difficult to fit into the Benetton but liked the 
                                        steering and throttle response. Häkkinen expected not to be 
                                        offered a seat at Benetton and he decided to sign with the 
                                        Lotus team for the 1991 season. Making his debut in the 
                                        United States Grand Prix alongside teammate Julian Bailey, 
                                        Häkkinen qualified thirteenth on the grid and suffered an 
                                        engine failure on the sixtieth lap and was classified 
                                        thirteenth. The next race in Brazil saw him finish ninth, 
                                        and scored his first Formula One points by reaching fifth 
                                        place in San Marino. Häkkinen suffered from a dip in 
                                        race form as he encountered consecutive retirements in the 
                                        next two races—his car suffered from an oil leak in Monaco 
                                        and spun out in Canada. Before Canada, Bailey lost 
                                        his seat at Lotus due to a lack of funding, so Häkkinen 
                                        was partnered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Herbert" 
                                        target="_blank">Johnny Herbert</a> and Michael Bartels throughout 
                                        the remainder of the season. Although Häkkinen secured a 
                                        ninth-place finish in Mexico, he did not qualify for the 
                                        French Grand Prix. Over the remainder of the season, he did 
                                        not finish four of the nine races he entered. Häkkinen 
                                        finished his debut season sixteenth in the Drivers' 
                                        Championship, scoring two points.

                                        Mika moved to McLaren in 1993. There, he developed. In 1998, 
                                        partnered by Coulthard, Häkkinen was confident going about the 
                                        challenge for the World Championship into the season, citing 
                                        the involvement of technical director Adrian Newey. The 
                                        season started off with controversy in Australia when teammate 
                                        Coulthard let Häkkinen past to win the race. Häkkinen had 
                                        earlier been called into the pit lane by an engineer by mistake. 
                                        Coulthard later revealed a pre-race agreement by the team that 
                                        whoever led into the first corner on the first lap would be 
                                        allowed to win the race. Despite this, Häkkinen took 
                                        back-to-back victories by winning the next race in Brazil. 
                                        He maintained his good form at the Argentine Grand Prix where 
                                        he finished second, although he retired from the San Marino 
                                        Grand Prix when his car's gearbox failed. However, Häkkinen 
                                        managed consecutive victories in the next two rounds, which was 
                                        followed by a retirement from the race in Canada as his car 
                                        suffered another gearbox failure. Häkkinen followed this up by 
                                        taking consecutive podiums in the next two rounds—third in 
                                        France and second in Britain. He managed further consecutive 
                                        victories in the next two rounds, and followed this up with 
                                        a sixth-place finish in Hungary. In August, it was announced 
                                        that Häkkinen and Coulthard would be retained for 1999. 
                                        Häkkinen retired from the following race held in Belgium when 
                                        Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher collided with the Finn and 
                                        was also hit by Sauber driver Johnny Herbert. He later 
                                        managed a fourth position in Italy despite suffering from 
                                        brake problems resulting from a spin. Häkkinen finished 
                                        the season by taking victory in the final two rounds at the 
                                        Luxembourg Grand Prix and the Japanese Grand Prix, which 
                                        ensured he took enough points to clinch the 1998 World 
                                        Championship, with 100 points, ahead of nearest rival 
                                        Schumacher. Häkkinen was awarded the Autosport 
                                        International Racing Driver Award for 1998. He was 
                                        also named the Finnish Sports Personality of the Year by 
                                        journalists. The Finnish Post Office issued stamps to 
                                        commemorate Häkkinen's World Championship in January 1999.

                                        Mika continued with McLaren. He also won World Championship
