                                        <span>Ayrton Senna</span> was born at 2:35 AM (05:35 GMT) on Monday, 
                                        21 March 1960, in the Pro-Matre Maternity Hospital of Santana, 
                                        a neighbourhood of São Paulo. The middle child of a wealthy 
                                        Brazilian family, he was born to landowner and factory owner Milton 
                                        Guirado da Silva and his wife Neide Senna da Silva; he had an older 
                                        sister, Viviane, and a younger brother, Leonardo. He was left-handed.
                                        Senna's mother was the granddaughter of Italian immigrants, 
                                        while his father was born to a Spanish mother (from Tíjola, Province 
                                        of Almería) and a Brazilian father from São Paulo.
                                        The house where Senna spent the first four years of his life belonged 
                                        to Neide's father, João Senna. It was located on the corner of Avenida 
                                        Aviador Guilherme with Avenida Gil Santos Dumont, less than 100 meters 
                                        from Campo de Marte, a large area where they operated the Aeronautics 
                                        Material park and an airport. Senna was highly athletic, excelling in 
                                        gymnastics and other sports, and developed an interest in cars and motor 
                                        racing at the age of four. However, as a small boy, he had poor motor 
                                        coordination and had trouble climbing stairways by the age of three. 
                                        An electroencephalogram (EEG) was unremarkable (i.e. showed no 
                                        abnormalities). Senna's parents nicknamed him "Beco". At the age of 
                                        seven, Senna first learned to drive a Jeep around his family's farm and 
                                        also how to change gears without using a clutch. Senna's first kart was 
                                        built by his father using a small 1-HP lawnmower engine. Senna started 
                                        racing at Interlagos and entered a karting competition at the age of 13.
                                        He started his first race on pole position, facing rivals who were 
                                        some years older than him; despite this, he managed to lead most of the 
                                        race before retiring after colliding with a rival. His father supported 
                                        his son and Lucio Pascal Gascon soon managed the developing talent.
                                        Senna went on to win the South American Kart Championship in 1977. 
                                        He contested the Karting World Championship each year from 1978 to 1982, 
                                        finishing runner-up in 1979 and 1980. In 1978, he was the teammate of 
                                        Terry Fullerton, from whom Senna later felt was the rival he got the most 
                                        satisfaction racing against also because of the lack of money and politics 
                                        at that level.

                                        Senna made his debut at the Brazilian Grand Prix in Rio de Janeiro, 
                                        where he qualified 17th, but retired when the Hart 415T turbocharger 
                                        failed on lap 8. He scored his first World Championship point when he 
                                        finished 6th in his second race at the South African Grand Prix at Kyalami 
                                        with severe cramp in his neck and shoulders, and replicated that result 
                                        two weeks later at the Belgian Grand Prix. In 1988, due to the relationship he 
                                        had built up with Honda throughout the 1987 season with Lotus, and with the 
                                        approval of McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, 
                                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Prost" target="_blank">Alain Prost</a>, 
                                        Senna joined the McLaren team. The foundation for a fierce 
                                        competition between Senna and Prost was laid, culminating in a number of 
                                        dramatic race incidents between the two over the next five years. However, 
                                        the experienced pair also quickly realized, despite their personal rivalry, 
                                        they had to work together, especially in testing, to keep ahead of their main 
                                        opposition from Ferrari, Williams, Benetton and Lotus. Ultimately, 
                                        the pair won 15 of 16 races in the dominant McLaren MP4/4 in 1988 with 
                                        Senna coming out on top, winning his first Formula One world championship 
                                        title by taking eight wins to Prost's seven. Prost scored more points over 
                                        the season, but had to drop three-second places as only the 11 best scores 
                                        counted, meaning that Senna bested Prost by 3 points.

                                        Senna also won World Titles with McLaren in 1990 and 1991 making him 3-time
                                        World Champion. In 1994, Senna joined Williams. The 1994 San Marino Grand 
                                        Prix was held on the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari circuit located in 
                                        Imola, Italy, between 28 April, and 1 May 1994. The European leg of the 
                                        F1 season, starting at Imola, was traditionally considered the beginning 
                                        of the yearly competition. During Saturday qualifying, Austrian rookie

                                        was killed after the front wing of his Simtek-Ford 
                                        broke entering the 310 km/h (190 mph) Villeneuve corner, sending the car 
                                        into the concrete retaining wall at high speed.

                                        At the start of the Grand 
                                        Prix, Senna retained the lead from his chief rival 
                                        <a href="schumacher.html">Michael Schumacher</a>, 
                                        but proceedings were soon interrupted by a startline accident. JJ Lehto's 
                                        Benetton-Ford stalled and was hit by the Lotus-Mugen Honda of Pedro Lamy. 
                                        A wheel and debris landed in the main grandstand, injuring eight fans and 
                                        a police officer. The safety car, a sporty version of the Opel Vectra 
                                        medium family saloon, was deployed for several laps. However, the Vectra's 
                                        lack of speed proved detrimental to the racers, as the slower pace allowed 
                                        the tyres of the Formula One cars to cool, thus decreasing their pressure. 
                                        Senna pulled alongside the Vectra and gestured to the driver, Max Angelelli,
                                        to increase his speed. On lap 6, the race resumed and Senna 
                                        immediately set a quick pace, completing the third-fastest lap of the race, 
                                        followed by Schumacher. As Senna rounded the high-speed Tamburello 
                                        corner on lap 7, his car left the racing line at around 307 km/h (191 mph), 
                                        ran in a straight line off the track, and hit the concrete retaining 
                                        wall at around 233 km/h (145 mph), after what telemetry showed to be 
                                        an application of the brakes for around two seconds. The red flag was 
                                        shown as a consequence of the accident. Within two minutes of crashing, 
                                        Senna was extracted from his race car by Watkins and his medical team, 
                                        including intensive care anaesthetist Giovanni Gordini. The initial 
                                        treatment took place by the side of the car, with Senna having a weak 
                                        heartbeat and significant blood loss from his temporal artery being 
                                        ruptured. At this point, Senna had already lost around 4.5 litres of blood, 
                                        constituting 90% of his blood volume. Because of Senna's grave 
                                        neurological condition, Watkins performed an on-site tracheotomy and 
                                        requested the immediate airlifting of Senna to Bologna's Maggiore 
                                        Hospital under the supervision of Gordini. At 18:40 (16:40 GMT), the head 
                                        of the hospital's emergency department, Maria Teresa Fiandri made 
                                        the announcement that Senna had died, but said the official time of death 
                                        under Italian law was 14:17 (12:17 GMT), which is when he impacted the wall 
                                        and his brain stopped functioning.<br>
                                        Ayrton Senna is remembered for his incredible driving skill and his even
                                        better personality. There is no Brazillian who doesn't know who Ayrton Senna
                                        was, a textbook example of F1 Legend.
